Project Crop Recommendation System, funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), serves as a pivotal tool for Rajasthan's agricultural community. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and satellite imagery, this initiative empowers farmers across Rajasthan to make informed decisions regarding crop selection. By harnessing the power of satellite data, the project systematically analyzes various environmental factors to predict the optimal crops for any given location within the state. Through this innovative approach, farmers gain access to tailored recommendations, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability statewide.
